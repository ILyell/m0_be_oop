# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? Good, takes a little bit of research but having the base understanding for what I'm looking for helps a lot!
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? Good, if I struggle for me then say 15minutes I take a break either by doing another task or doing something else entierly 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? Checking the ruby docs! Research is the most powerful tool you can have in my opioion.
